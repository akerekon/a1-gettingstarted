## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the a, h1, h2, table, th, td, ul, and button selectors, as well as rules for the center, iconImages, familyPhoto, colorWheel, colorButton, iconContainer, buttonContainer, and padRight classes for proper formatting, color scheme, and font usage
- **Added JavaScript animations**: Added "fade-in" animation on the page body so that all text and images slowly appears over 3 seconds, as well as a background color selector script to change the background to one of four color-blind-safe colors
- **Experimented with HTML tags**: Added img, table (and table header/table data), as well as ul (and li) elements to add images, structure the classes I've taken, and list my experience with several programming technologies


### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette using color.adobe.com**: Styled a neutral color palette using five color-blind-safe colors that are accessible to users with Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia, with one main color for the headers as well as four user-selectable background themes
- **Used the Arvo and Open Sans Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Arvo as the font for my headers as well as Open Sans for the body of my webpage, both of which are designed with legibility and accesibility in mind
